          "CMB stands for **Cosmic Microwave Background**. It's the afterglow of the Big Bang, a faint radiation that fills the entire universe. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n\n*   **Origin:** About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe had cooled enough for electrons and protons to combine and form neutral hydrogen atoms. Before this time, the universe was a hot, dense plasma where photons (light particles) constantly scattered off free electrons. Once neutral atoms formed, photons could travel freely through space. This is the light we see today as the CMB.\n\n*   **Characteristics:**\n    *   **Microwave Radiation:** The CMB is primarily in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n    *   **Uniformity:** It's remarkably uniform in temperature across the sky, about 2.725 Kelvin (-270.425 degrees Celsius or -454.765 degrees Fahrenheit).\n    *   **Tiny Fluctuations:** There are very slight temperature variations (on the order of a few parts per million) in the CMB. These tiny fluctuations are incredibly important because they represent the seeds of all the structures we see in the universe today, like galaxies and clusters of galaxies.\n\n*   **Significance:**\n    *   **Evidence for the Big Bang:** The CMB is considered one of the strongest pieces of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory.\n    *   **Understanding the Early Universe:** Studying the CMB allows scientists to learn about the conditions of the early universe, including its age, composition, and geometry.\n    *   **Cosmological Parameters:** The CMB provides precise measurements of key cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble constant (the rate of expansion of the universe) and the density of matter and energy in the universe.\n\n*   **How it's Studied:** Scientists use specialized telescopes and satellites, like the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the Planck satellite, to observe and map the CMB.\n\nIn short, the CMB is a relic of the early universe that provides a wealth of information about its origins and evolution.\n"
