It is a form of electromagnetic radiation that fills the universe and is detectable in all directions. The CMB is a key piece of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory, which posits that the universe began as a hot, dense state and has been expanding ever since.\n\nThe CMB was first predicted in the 1940s by George Gamow and his colleagues, who theorized that the universe, shortly after the Big Bang, was filled with a hot plasma of particles. As the universe expanded and cooled, this plasma eventually transitioned into neutral hydrogen atoms, allowing photons to travel freely. This event, known as \"recombination,\" occurred approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang, leading to the decoupling of matter and radiation.\n\nThe CMB was first detected in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, who observed a uniform background radiation at microwave wavelengths. This discovery provided strong empirical support for the Big Bang model and earned the researchers the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978. The CMB has a nearly perfect blackbody spectrum with a temperature of about 2.7 Kelvin, which corresponds to the peak of the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nThe CMB is not entirely uniform; it exhibits slight fluctuations in temperature and polarization, which are indicative of the density variations in the early universe. These fluctuations are crucial for understanding the formation of large-scale structures, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Detailed measurements of the CMB, particularly from missions such as the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the Planck satellite, have provided insights into fundamental cosmological parameters, including the age of the universe, the rate of its expansion, and the composition of its matter and energy.\n\nIn summary, the Cosmic Microwave Background serves as a cornerstone of modern cosmology, offering a snapshot of the universe when it was just a few hundred thousand years old.

These fluctuations are crucial for understanding the formation of large-scale structures, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Detailed measurements of the CMB, particularly from missions such as the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the Planck satellite, have provided insights into fundamental cosmological parameters, including the age of the universe, the rate of its expansion, and the composition of its matter and energy.\n\nIn summary, the Cosmic Microwave Background serves as a cornerstone of modern cosmology, offering a snapshot of the universe when it was just a few hundred thousand years old. Its study continues to yield significant insights into the fundamental processes that shaped the cosmos and the underlying physics governing its evolution.\n```\n\nCalling executor...\n\nMessage from executor:\n\nexecution results:\nExecution output: Content saved to /Users/licongxu/Work/astropilot/cmbagent/output/CMB.md\n\n\nCalling executor_response_formatter...\n\n             Model                       agent    Cost  Prompt Tokens  Completion Tokens  Total Tokens\ngpt-4.1-2025-04-14 executor_response_formatter 0.00448           1680                 14          1694\nMessage from executor_response_formatter:\n\nTransfer to control.\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nWorkflow status:\n\nPlan step number: 1\n\nAgent for sub-task (might be different from the next agent suggestion for debugging): researcher\n\nCurrent status (before execution): In progress\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n\nCalling control...\n\n             Model   agent    Cost  Prompt Tokens  Completion Tokens  Total Tokens\ngpt-4.1-2025-04-14 control 0.00658           1691                 40          1731\nMessage from control:\n\n\n**Step number:** 1 out of 1.\n \n**Sub-task:** solve the main task.\n \n**Agent in charge of sub-task:** `researcher`\n \n**Instructions:**\n \nsolve the main task.\n \n**Status:** completed ✅\n    \n\nCalling terminator...\n\n            Model      agent    Cost  Prompt Tokens  Completion Tokens  Total Tokens\ngpt-4o-2024-11-20 terminator 0.00306           1215                  2          1217\nMessage from terminator:\n\nSession terminated.\n| Agent                         | Cost                  | Prompt Tokens | Completion Tokens | Total Tokens |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| executor response formatter   | 0.0044800000000000005 | 1680.0        | 14.0              | 1694.0       |\n| researcher response formatter | 0.0030480999999999998 | 615.0         | 539.0             | 1154.0       |\n| terminator                    | 0.0030575000000000003 | 1215.0        | 2.0               | 1217.0       |\n| researcher                    | 0.0002980499999999999 | 227.0         | 440.0             | 667.0        |\n| control                       | 0.006582000000000001  | 1691.0        | 40.0              | 1731.0       |\n| Total                         | 0.01746565            | 5428.0        | 1035.0            | 6463.0       |\n",
