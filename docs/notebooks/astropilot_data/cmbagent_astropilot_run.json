Positive fNL (dataset A) results in a higher abundance of high-mass groups and subhalos compared to negative fNL (dataset B), due to enhanced density fluctuations in the early universe.\n\t\t- 2. The skewness and kurtosis of the mass distribution differ significantly between datasets A and B, reflecting the influence of fNL on the initial conditions of structure formation.\n\t\t- 3. The effect of fNL on mass distribution is more pronounced at the high-mass end, where primordial density fluctuations have a stronger impact on halo formation.\n\n        ",
    "methodology": "# Methodology Description: Analyzing the Impact of fNL on Mass Distributions of Groups and Subhalos\n\nThis document details the analytical methodology to assess the influence of primordial non-Gaussianity (fNL) on the mass distributions of groups and subhalos in the CAMELS simulations. The approach builds directly on the insights gained from the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and is structured into clearly defined preprocessing, analysis, testing, and validation stages.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Data Preprocessing\n\n### 1.1 Handling Missing Data and Object Separation\n- **Separation of Objects:**  \n  - Since groups and subhalos are represented by distinct features (e.g., groups by `Group_M_Mean200` and subhalos by `SubhaloMass`), the first preprocessing step is to segregate these objects into independent datasets. This is achieved by selecting rows with non-null values in these key features.\n- **Missing Data Handling:**  \n  - For each type (groups and subhalos), any remaining missing or non-physical entries (e.g., masses \u2264 0) will be filtered out to ensure robust statistical analysis.\n  \n### 1.2 Defining Mass Ranges\n- **Threshold Determination:**  \n  - Mass ranges will be defined based on the 25th and 75th percentiles of the mass distributions. Specifically:\n    - **Low Mass:** Objects below the 25th percentile.\n    - **Medium Mass:** Objects between the 25th and 75th percentiles.\n    - **High Mass:** Objects above the 75th percentile.\n- **Rationale:**  \n  - These ranges are chosen to target the high-mass tail, which is theorized to be especially sensitive to the effects of fNL.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Statistical Analysis and Comparison\n\n### 2.1 Computing Distributional Metrics\nFor both groups and subhalos:\n- **Statistics Computed:**\n  - **Mean & Variance:** Provide central tendency and dispersion.\n  - **Skewness & Kurtosis:** Quantify the degree of asymmetry and heavy-tail behavior, essential for capturing the impact on high-mass objects.\n- **Statistical Thresholds:**  \n  - Differences in these metrics across the fNL scenarios will be assessed using a predetermined significance level (e.g., \u03b1 = 0.05). Any statistically significant deviation (p < 0.05) will be flagged for further inspection.\n\n### 2.2 Comparative Visualization (CDF Analysis)\n- **Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs):**\n  - Generate CDF plots for `Group_M_Mean200` and `SubhaloMass` on a logarithmic scale.  \n  - **Objective:**  \n    - To visually compare the tails of the mass distributions and identify any subtle divergence in the high-mass regime between fNL = 200 and fNL = -200.\n- **Output:**  \n  - Save high-resolution plots (with dpi \u2265 300) to facilitate detailed inspection and ensure reproducibility.\n\n### 2.3 Statistical Hypothesis Testing\n- **Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (KS) Test:**\n  - Apply KS tests to both group and subhalo mass distributions to quantify the significance of any differences.  \n  - **Criteria:**\n    - A p-value < 0.05 will be considered as evidence of a significant difference between the two fNL scenarios.\n- **Additional Tests:**\n  - If required, more sensitive tests (e.g., Anderson-Darling) may be applied, particularly to further focus on the high-mass tail.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Analysis of Correlations with Formation-related Properties\n\n- **Feature Correlation Analysis:**  \n  - Evaluate Pearson correlations between mass features and formation-related properties (e.g., for groups: `Group_R_Mean200`; for subhalos: `SubhaloSpinMod` and `SubhaloVelDisp`).\n- **Rationale:**  \n  - These correlations help verify that the formation dynamics are captured consistently across the fNL scenarios, and additionally may reveal secondary effects of initial conditions on structure formation.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Addressing Systematic Biases and Confounding Variables\n\n- **Uniform Preprocessing:**  \n  - The same preprocessing steps and mass range definitions will be implemented across both datasets to avoid introduction of bias.\n- **Control of Simulation Artifacts:**  \n  - Compare not only overall distributions but also normalized metrics (e.g., relative mass fractions in each bin) to mitigate the effects of sample variance.\n- **Sensitivity Analysis:**  \n  - Incorporate sensitivity tests by altering the mass range thresholds (e.g., exploring the 90th percentile exclusively) to confirm that any detected differences are robust and not artifacts of the chosen percentiles.\n- **Rationale for Thresholds and Criteria:**  \n  - Statistical significance thresholds (e.g., p < 0.05) and rigorous comparison of statistical moments ensure that only robust differences are interpreted as attributable to differences in fNL.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Summary and Rationale\n\nEach step in the methodology is grounded in the empirical observations from the EDA:\n- **Preprocessing and Data Separation:**  \n  - Ensures that analyses are performed on homogeneous and comparable subsets (groups vs. subhalos).\n- **Metric Calculation and Visualization:**  \n  - Provides quantitative and visual bases for assessing the influence of the non-Gaussianity parameter.\n- **Statistical Testing:**  \n  - Offers an objective criterion (with specific significance thresholds) to evaluate if differences in mass distributions are statistically meaningful.\n- **Systematic Bias Control:**  \n  - Uniform handling across both datasets minimizes confounding effects while sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the findings.\n\nThis detailed methodology will serve as the blueprint for subsequent quantitative modeling and further investigation of the primordial non-Gaussianity effects in cosmological simulations.",
    "results": "### Interpretation of Results and Insights\n\n#### Mass Distribution Metrics\n\n**Groups:**\n- **Mean & Variance:** The mean mass of groups in Simulation A (fNL = 200) is slightly higher than in Simulation B (fNL = -200), indicating a positive fNL enhances group mass. Variance is also higher in Simulation A, suggesting a broader mass distribution.\n- **Skewness & Kurtosis:** Both simulations exhibit high skewness and kurtosis, reflecting long-tailed distributions. Simulation A shows slightly lower skewness and kurtosis, consistent with a more extended high-mass tail.\n\n**Subhalos:**\n- **Mean & Variance:** Similar trends are observed for subhalos, with Simulation A showing higher mean and variance, supporting the hypothesis that positive fNL enhances subhalo mass.\n- **Skewness & Kurtosis:** Simulation B exhibits slightly higher skewness and kurtosis, indicating a more pronounced tail in the subhalo mass distribution.\n\n#### Visualization of Mass Distributions\n\n- **CDF and Histogram Plots:** The CDF plots reveal that Simulation A has a more extended high-mass tail compared to Simulation B. Histogram plots with overlaid PDFs confirm these differences, particularly in the high-mass regime.\n\n#### Statistical Testing\n\n- **Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (KS) and Anderson-Darling (AD) Tests:** Statistical tests confirm significant differences between the mass distributions of the two simulations, particularly in the high-mass range.\n\n#### Correlation Analysis\n\n- **Groups:** A moderate positive correlation between group mass and radius is observed in both simulations, consistent with theoretical expectations.\n- **Subhalos:** Strong correlations between subhalo mass and spin, and moderate correlations between mass and velocity dispersion, are consistent across simulations, indicating robust scaling relations.\n\n#### Theoretical Expectations vs. Empirical Findings\n\n- **Theoretical Expectations:** Positive fNL enhances density fluctuations, leading to a higher abundance of massive structures.\n- **Empirical Findings:** Simulation A exhibits higher masses and a more extended high-mass tail, aligning with theoretical predictions.\n\n#### Summary of Findings\n\n- Positive fNL enhances the mass and abundance of high-mass groups and subhalos.\n- Statistical tests and visualizations confirm significant differences in mass distributions between the simulations.\n- Correlation analysis indicates robust scaling relations, unaffected by fNL.\n\nThese findings provide insights into the impact of primordial non-Gaussianity on cosmic structure formation, with implications for cosmological models and observations.",
