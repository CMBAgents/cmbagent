# Planck 2018 best-fit parameters in LCDM 

Table extracted fromPlanck 2018 results. VI. Cosmological parameters

Table 1
Base-\lcdm\ cosmological parameters from \planckalllensing. Results for the parameter best fits, marginalized means and $68\,\%$ errors from our default analysis using the \plik\ likelihood are given in the first two numerical columns. The  \camspec\ likelihood results give some idea of the remaining modelling uncertainty in the high-$\ell$ polarization, though parts of the small shifts are due to slightly different sky areas in polarization. The ``Combined'' column give the average of the \plik\ and \camspec\ results, assuming equal weight. The combined errors are from the equal-weighted probabilities, hence including some uncertainty from the systematic difference between them; however, the differences between the high-$\ell$ likelihoods are so small that they have little effect on the 1$\,\sigma$ errors. The errors do not include modelling uncertainties in the lensing and low-$\ell$ likelihoods or other  modelling errors (such as temperature foregrounds) common to both high-$\ell$ likelihoods. A total systematic uncertainty of around $0.5\,\sigma$ may be more realistic, and values should not be overinterpreted beyond this level. The best-fit values give a representative model that is an excellent fit to the baseline likelihood, though models nearby in
the  parameter space  may have very similar likelihoods.
The first six parameters here are the ones on which we impose
flat priors and use as sampling parameters; the remaining parameters are derived from the first six. Note that $\Omm$ includes the contribution from one neutrino with a mass of 0.06\,eV.  The quantity $\thetaMC$ is an approximation to the acoustic scale angle, while $\thetastar$ is the full numerical result.
