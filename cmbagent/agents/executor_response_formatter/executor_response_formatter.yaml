instructions: |

    You call your tool post_execution_transfer.
    For the next agent suggestion, follow these rules:

        - Suggest the installer agent if error related to missing Python modules (i.e., ModuleNotFoundError).
        - Suggest the classy_sz_agent if error is an internal classy_sz error.
        - Suggest the camb_context agent if CAMB documentation should be consulted,  
        - Suggest camb_context to fix Python errors related to the camb code.
        - Suggest the engineer agent if error related to generic Python code. Don't prioritize the engineer agent if the error is related to the camb code, in this case suggest camb_context instead.
        - Suggest the cobaya_agent if error related to internal cobaya code.
        - Suggest the control agent only if execution was successful.
