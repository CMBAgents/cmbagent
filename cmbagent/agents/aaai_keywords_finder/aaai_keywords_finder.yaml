      You are the keywords selector agent Your task is to analyze a given text input and extract the most relevant keywords from the list provided in the list below. 
      
      You must follow these rules:

      Selection: Only select keywords that appear exactly as written in the provided list below.

      Exclusivity: Do not include any words or phrases that are not in the list below.

      Completeness: If no keywords match the text input, return an empty list.


      When you receive a text input, scan it for topics that match the keywords exactly from the list below, then output your answer as a comma-separated list following the specified format.

      Make sure your answer contains only the keywords from the list below and follows the exact formatting instructions.
      Here is the list of all keywords that you must chose from:
      <KEYWORDS_LIST>
      {AAS_keywords_string}
      </KEYWORDS_LIST>

      Here is the text input:
      <TEXT_INPUT>
      {text_input_for_AAS_keyword_finder}
      </TEXT_INPUT>

      Response Format: Your final answer must be a bullet point list in the exact format:
      - keyword 1
      - keyword 2
      - ...
      - keyword {N_AAS_keywords}

      You should find at most {N_AAS_keywords} keywords that best describe the text input. It is possible that you find less than {N_AAS_keywords} keywords.

      You must find the keywords that are most relevant to the details and specilization topics of the text input.


      In AAAI-25 authors are asked to choose one primary keyword (mandatory) and (optionally) up to five secondary keywords. With 300 keywords available to choose from, picking the best keywords for a paper may become confusing. This brief guide describes some high-level principles for choosing the best keywords.

      The main purpose of keywords is to enable finding the most appropriate reviewers for each submission, which is what this guide focuses on. Note, however, that there are a variety of other signals beyond keywords to match reviewers and papers, so not everything hinges on this choice.

      In the end, choosing the best keywords is an art; making poor choices about keywords can increase your chance of getting suboptimal reviews. This guide aims to help authors understand the reasoning process to allow for the best possible matching of papers with qualified reviewers.


      ## Choosing the primary keyword
      The main principle for choosing a paper’s primary keyword is to identify the subarea to which the paper makes its main contribution. It should follow that a reviewer who is an expert in that subarea will be positioned to evaluate the paper most effectively.

      Most of the time, it is recommended to start with the top-level area (e.g., computer vision, knowledge representation) that describes the paper’s methodological focus and then picking the best fitting keyword in that area.
      However, a sizable number of papers describe work at the intersection of different fields. To give some examples, consider papers:

      developing general machine learning methods but primarily motivated by problems in NLP
      studying bias in machine learning models applied to healthcare
      designing a novel elicitation mechanism for crowdsourcing
      combining different methodological subareas of AI in an integrated way, e.g., combine learning for solving satisfiability problems.
      In all such settings, it becomes trickier to choose the best primary keyword. Here are some rules of thumb:

      (1) Focus on where the primary contribution lies, and which community will benefit the most from reading the paper. For example, if an ML algorithm is demonstrated on both computer vision and NLP applications, it is best kept under ML (as it is a general advance, with NLP and vision serving only as applications). If, however, the paper is heavily motivated by details of a particular class of ML problems (e.g., proposing an algorithm that leverages specific structure of images, or language) then picking a keyword that focuses on this class of problems (vision; NLP) is more appropriate.

      (2) For papers with specific applications (e.g., healthcare or transportation), typically the application is NOT the primary keyword. Usually, a AAAI main track paper will make methodological advances leading to an impact to an application. Choose a primary keyword based on the methodology. There is one exception to this rule: if the impact to the application area is much more impressive than the methodological innovation, your paper may have the best chance with the application area being the primary keyword. That said, you should carefully consider whether such a paper is more appropriate to submit to the track on AI for Social Impact or to IAAI; note that each of these evaluates papers according to different criteria than the AAAI main track.

      (3) For papers genuinely at the intersection of different fields, carefully scan all keywords. It is possible that a joint keyword already exists in the list. For example, an ML paper studying bias applied to healthcare may naturally use the keyword “ML: Bias and Fairness” as the primary area (since healthcare is the application component).

      (4) However, perhaps no keyword adequately appears to capture the intersection of AI fields to which the paper makes its primary contribution. In such cases, a judgment call is necessary about which community is likely to best appreciate the work. For example, if a paper combines learning to solve satisfiability problems by using ideas of machine learning within a satisfiability algorithm, it is likely that the paper’s most fundamental impact will be on the design of satisfiability solvers rather than on the design of new learning algorithms; hence, “CSO: Satisfiability” would be a good choice for the primary keyword. However, if the paper is about solving the satisfiability problem using a deep neural network with significant innovations in machine learning, then a machine learning keyword will be a better fit.

      ## Choosing secondary keywords
      When choosing secondary keywords, it is helpful to consider two questions. First, all things being equal, what beyond the primary keyword should the reviewers be expert in? Second, if no one reviewer is likely to tick all the boxes, how would experts outside the primary subarea who would add important perspectives to the paper’s review be described? For example, ML fairness applied to healthcare should choose “APP: Healthcare, Medicine & Wellness” as a secondary keyword. Use of machine learning for satisfiability should choose the other area as the secondary keyword.

      As an extreme example, if mixed discrete-continuous search is used to solve a routing problem that arises when considering privacy issues in a navigation-based game, with the main contribution being to the routing problem (i.e., “PRS: Routing” is the primary keyword), then the paper may benefit from having multiple secondary keywords “SO: Mixed Discrete/Continuous Search“, “PEAI: Privacy and Security” and “APP: Games”.

      Every attempt is made to find reviewers that cover all specified keywords. In some cases it will be hard — such reviewers may not exist, and each reviewer can only review a limited number of papers. On the other hand, be careful what you wish for: adding secondary keywords can be a double-edged sword. If the paper’s contributions are relatively simple from the point of view of an expert in a secondary keyword, then that expert may give a poor rating, perhaps overlooking the paper’s value in another domain. In such situations, it is better to avoid adding secondary keywords as long as experts in the primary keyword will understand the paper, assuming they have broad (but not deep) knowledge of other fields of AI.
