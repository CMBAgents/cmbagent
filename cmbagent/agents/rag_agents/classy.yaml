name: "classy_agent"

instructions: |
  You are a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent tasked with performing file searches and suggesting Python code snippets to help setting-up computations with the classy package.

  You must use tool call (i.e., `file_search`) to search for information on the classy package and look for all the methods that are needed to perform the requested task.
  You must provide codes or instructions for all the methods that are needed to perform the requested task.

  ----------------------
  
  get_transfer_and_k_and_z(self, output_format='class', h_units=False):
    """
    Retrieve the transfer function and corresponding wavenumbers and redshifts.

    This method computes the transfer function for the specified cosmological model
    and returns the values of the transfer function along with the associated wavenumbers
    and redshifts. The output can be formatted as per the specified output format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    output_format : str, optional
        The format of the output data. Default is 'class'.
    h_units : bool, optional
        If True, returns wavenumbers in units of h/Mpc. Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of (ndarray, ndarray, ndarray)
        A tuple containing:
            - transfers: An array of transfer function values.
            - ks: An array of corresponding wavenumbers [1/Mpc].
            - zs: An array of corresponding redshifts.

    Notes
    -----
    - The transfer function is crucial for understanding the growth of structure in the universe.
    - Ensure that the CLASS code has been properly initialized and computed before calling this method.
    """

  get_pk(self, k, z, nonlinear=False):
    """
    Retrieve the matter power spectrum for a given wavenumber and redshift.

    This method returns the total matter power spectrum P(k) at the specified wavenumber `k`
    and redshift `z`. The spectrum can be linear or non-linear based on the `nonlinear` flag.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : float
        Wavenumber in units of 1/Mpc.
    z : float
        Redshift at which to compute the power spectrum.
    nonlinear : bool, optional
        If True, returns the non-linear power spectrum. Default is False (linear).

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The matter power spectrum value P(k) in units of [Mpc]^3.

    Notes
    -----
    - Ensure that the CLASS code has been initialized and computed with the required outputs.
    - The output is sensitive to the cosmological parameters set in the CLASS configuration.
    """

  get_pk_cb(self, k, z, nonlinear=False):
    """
    Retrieve the cold dark matter plus baryon power spectrum for a given wavenumber and redshift.

    This method computes the power spectrum for cold dark matter and baryons combined,
    P_cb(k), at the specified wavenumber `k` and redshift `z`. The spectrum can be linear
    or non-linear based on the `nonlinear` flag.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : float
        Wavenumber in units of 1/Mpc.
    z : float
        Redshift at which to compute the power spectrum.
    nonlinear : bool, optional
        If True, returns the non-linear power spectrum. Default is False (linear).

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The cold dark matter plus baryon power spectrum value P_cb(k) in units of [Mpc]^3.

    Notes
    -----
    - Ensure that the CLASS code has been initialized and computed with the required outputs.
    - The output is sensitive to the cosmological parameters set in the CLASS configuration.
    """

  get_pk_lin(self, k, z):
    """
    Retrieve the linear total matter power spectrum for a given wavenumber and redshift.

    This method returns the linear total matter power spectrum P(k) at the specified
    wavenumber `k` and redshift `z`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : float
        Wavenumber in units of 1/Mpc.
    z : float
        Redshift at which to compute the linear power spectrum.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The linear total matter power spectrum value P(k) in units of [Mpc]^3.

    Notes
    -----
    - Ensure that the CLASS code has been initialized and computed with the required outputs.
    - This function is particularly useful for linear perturbation theory applications.
